# Netflix-Clone
I have built a Netflix clone user interface using HTML and CSS, and it was an exciting and enriching experience! ðŸš€ This project helped me dive deeper into front-end development, focusing on layout, responsiveness, and design aesthetics. This project was a fun way to explore styling techniques and improve my CSS skills.
